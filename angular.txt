/In 2023 we are using Version 16 of Angular 

/Angular is front end web development framework.

/npm(node package manager)

/angular CLI (command line interface)
= it is command line interface tool for which we can
use to create angular applications.
=it also use to create component,classes,services
=use to develope our project.

/to install angular CLI
1.in cmd hit "npm install -g @angular/cli" this url
2.to check version of angular cli "ng version"
3.to run angular application "ng serve"
4.to install bootstrap "npm install bootstrap --save" OR  ng add @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap
5.to create typescript class "ng g class classname"   -->'g' for generate
6.to enter in root project "cd .\projectName\"
7.to create component "ng g c second"  -->'c' for component

/main.ts file is entry point of application

/ *ngFor
-same as for loop in java

/ {{}} 
=this is called interpolation

/@Input
-input decorator is use to create custom-properties(those properties which are not present in html but still want to use for component) for component.

/bootstrap
-it helps to reduce use of css.

/Routing
-without reloading we can move to another url.

/Binding
1.Property binding= []
2.event binding= () 
ex: (click)="which-method-have-to-execute-after-clicking"

/Event-Propogation
-use to stop event bubbling

/MVC(model view controller)

/NPM(Node package manager)

/First version or oldest verion of angular is called angular js.But from 2016 it is called as "Angular".
Angular js is not in use nowdays.

/In angular 12 when we creates function with parameter we have to declare a datatype of argument becoz in "tsconfig.json" file the feild "Strict" is true.
if in "tsconfig.json" file the feild "Strict" is false then there is no need to define datatype of paramater of function.

/If we have write logic for style in style.css,in component.css,internal css first internal css will apply then componet css then style css will apply

/"ngIf" is a directive in Angular.

/Material UI
 -to make page responsive and give rich look to page we use material UI.

/Pipes always used in HTML page not in typeScript file.

/When we want to send data to database we use forms.
  -There are 2 types of forms are there in angular
  1.Template driven forms 
  -whole code for form will write in HTML file (app.component.html)
  2.Reactive forms
  -whole code for form will write in class file (app.component.ts)

/how many types of API are there
 -POST API
 -PUT API	
 -GET API
 -PATCH API ..etc


/StandAlone component
-those component who are not depend on any other module,component is called standalone component.

/View Engine is compiler.In angular 13 view engine is used as compiler.

________________________________________________________________________________________

-When we are importing Reactive form in app.module.ts we need to import formModule and formControl in ts file.
 -FormGroup = made all things of form in one group.
 -FormControl = it controls value of feilds
group of from control and form feild is form array

/There are 2 types in angular
 1.Template driven form - use for simple form. Its handling is done in HTML.
 -In template driven form we create object of formControl and  
  we initialize it.
 2.Reactive form - use for complex form. Its handling is done in ts file i.e. in javascript file

/ngModel, ngModelGroup , ngForm are the directives.
